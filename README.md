# WorkWithArrays

  Here are implemented educational tasks with arrays and sorting algorithms:

  1) Array initialisation (manual, random, shuffle);
  
  2) Calculation of the frequency of array elements (include finding the longest frequency);

  3) Using a standart reverse method and creating own;

  4) Read/Write array from/to file with a StreamReader/StreamWriter;

  5) Overloading comparison, addition and substraction operators for arrays;

  6) Sorting Algorithms:

  - Bubble Sorting;

  - Quick Sorting;

  - Merge Sorting;

  - Heap Sorting
